# Wellbeing Data Analysis
 
### Files in the repo:
- data_analysis.ipynb - the actual analysis file
- question_list.xlsx - basically a legend file in which every question has an assigned index number
- new_results_survey.csv - the final raw .csv file exported from our online survey
- new_results_survey.xlsx - same file but in the Excel format
- cleaned_data.xlsx - cleaned data; exported prior to being normalized for better clarity (higher values in this file imply more positive/frequent events)
- correlations.xlsx - correlation matrix in the form of a dataframe (it made it easier to see the labels of the items)

### Recent updates
1. Finished cleaning up the data for our analysis
2. Normalized data
3. Performed imputation for NaN values

### What else could still be done?
- review/checking if there are any errors
- interpretation of PCA + correlations
